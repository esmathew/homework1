What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
A merge takes changes from one branch and combines them with changes to another
branch, while preserving the source branch history. A rebase also integrates
changes from one branch to another, but removes unwanted entries from the branch history.

What is a remote repository?
A remote repository is a place to store copies of your project so that it can be accessed
from any location. Examples include local servers and the internet.
